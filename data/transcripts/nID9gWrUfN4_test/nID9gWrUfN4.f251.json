{"text": " The year is 2040. Everyone has to verify their identification via ice ganners and fingerprint machines. You can't legally order a pizza without verifying your social credit score is above 419. In order to chat with the boys, discord checks your government ID to make sure you're old enough to see anime memes. Nobody remembers the time when you could simply open up AIM and send your friend your new Hello World print implementation without five-factor authentication. I'm in the woods with Luke Smith talking to nobody because we both refuse to allow the snowball effect to occur with respect to surveillance, but I'm not alone. Enter the matrix. What's up guys, my name is Tony. And today I'm going to give you a quick and painless guide on matrix. In light of discord's recent announcement of their age inference model and identification verification coupled with the fact that discord is proprietary garbage anyway. There are much better options out there. Matrix is one of those options. Matrix is an open standard for decentralized encrypted communication. It's similar to email in that anyone can run a server and all servers talk to each other. What makes matrix special is it's got decentralized federation which allows servers to talk to each other and there's no single point of control. The messages are encrypted by default and to end. The protocol is fully open source so that means it's fully auditable. You're not locked into one specific client or even one specific server implementation. And there are persistent rooms similar to discord servers so it's not just group chats. For today we're going to show two paths to matrix. One is the normy path of least resistance which is simply setting up an account on matrix.org and joining a public room as needed. And the second path is going to be for the self-hosting enthusiast which I will show how to do and explain why it is a superior path. Both are better than discord though so let's jump right into the tutorial. All right so let's set over to matrix.org and click try matrix. And at this tiny little banner kind of bothers me so I'm going to get rid of it here. I'm just going to right click this div right here and delete that node. All right so let's go back into this. So there are tons of clients available and today we're going to go with some electron solop called element but it is clean and polished and kind of looks like discord so it is usable. It's in nix packages and for legacy distros it should be in Pacman, App, DNF and Portage etc. So let's go ahead and click on this here and we're going to use it on our browser today. So all you need to do is create an account here on matrix.org and then hit continue and then just make a username and then you're going to have to continue with an email address here and you would just fill like your email address accordingly here so for me it's going to be aatb.com that is my email. I've read it this. Make sure you're not a robot. I guess it's some traffic lights. I failed this sometimes because I feel a bit robotic in my soul but anyway so we'll go ahead and click continue here and obviously you got to verify the six digit codes sent to your email. Now my email is aatb.com so I'm going to verify that and I'll be right back. All right so I've verified that six digit code with aatb.com and now I'm in. So this is element here. It kind of looks like discord. You've got your spaces on a left which is going to be similar to your servers. No chats yet but it's going to be your group chats and stuff so it's going to feel similar to your discord experience. So once you're in here you can just join public rooms and I do have a public room on my servers so I'm actually just going to join my public room from this informia account so you're going to hit this search button here on the element client and then we'll type into the search bar pound linux colontony by the way.com and this is my public room here so we can join this from this account so we'll click that and there we go. This is our general linux server here and that's it. I can just send a quick hello world implementation here. Let's do it and see we'll do it in main void. We'll send a printf statement here as a snippet but yeah so we've sent our message here to the public channel and that's it. Welcome to matrix no government ID required, no proprietary garbage required. So if you want to stop here and just use matrix.org that's totally fine but if you want to self host your own server so you aren't beholden to matrix.org as a host I'm going to show you how you can do that next. So before we jump into the self hosting installation tutorial I do want to explain a small federation caveat. Now with matrix federation if you allow users on your home server your home server caches everything from any federated server that those users interact with. So if you have a user on your home server that joins some random matrix.org server then every single message is cached from that server into your home server which means you're now liable for all cached content including content you never saw or approved. This makes you potentially liable for a legal content that you never even knew about and this is why I prefer XMPP as a protocol because it doesn't have this problem but you can also simply avoid this by either doing a what I do is not allowing any registration on your server but make it public facing or be just use a matrix.org account instead of self hosting and then you're not actually caching anything because matrix.org is the server. Oh right so for self hosting we're going to need a few things and I'm going to thank Denshi for the b-roll on this. So he bought a laptop for $5 from a gift store and turned it into a server so I'll drop a link below the subscribe button on his video on the explanation of that but yeah we're going to need an old laptop which you can find in your dad's garage or your closet or a thrift store. We're going to need a domain name which you can get for three bucks a month and then you're going to need an internet connection. So we're going to set this up in our closet on a think pad and we are going to use a subdomain of the domain I already own which is tony by the way.com and then we are going to use nixowest today for deploying this server because it's declarative. It's reproducible. It's really easy to set up and we're going to disable registrations so that we don't have any liability on federated content but without further ado let's jump into the installation. All right so go ahead and head over to nixowest.org. Click that download link and scroll down to the ISOs here. We're going to grab the minimal ISO image 64 bit for Intel and AMD. I've got the minimal ISO loaded up here so as we load that up here we're going to type pseudo dash i to get into the root account and we will clear the terminal with control l here. So once we jump into the system here we can go ahead and run LSB okay to get the name of our device we see it's VDA so we can run CF disk on dev VDA and this is going to be an EFI system so I'm going to use GPT as the label. I'm just going to use two partitions today. One is going to be the boot partition. It's going to be one gigabyte. It's going to be EFI system for the type and the other one is just going to be the remainder of the space. It's going to be a Linux file system so I'm right that yes quit and I'm going to make the file systems here so we're going to do mkfs.ext4 dash l for label nixOS dev VDA2 and then for the boot partition we'll do mkfs dash f32 dash n boot for the label that's going to be on dev VDA1 not right so we can mount these now so we'll do control l to clear the terminal. We'll do mount dev VDA2 we're going to mount that to mnt and we'll do mount dash n to make the directory dev VDA1 mnt boot never go. All right so now that we've partitioned created and mounted our file systems we're ready to generate the config so we're going to run nixOS generate config it's going to be on root and that's going to be on mnt which will generate the hardware configuration file and the configuration file that we need so that looks good. Let's go ahead and cd into mnt etsy nixOS and as we see we've got those files right here and we're going to be editing these accordingly. Let's do a vim configuration.nix we see a lot of bloated comments in here so what I'm going to do is deep load this by just remembering a bunch of comments I'm going to probably speed this up in the post production process. All right so I've went ahead and deep loaded this file here so we can work with the let's start at the top we've got the import section and that's going to be the hardware configuration dot nix we're going to import one additional file and that's going to be matrix dot nix and we have it created that yet but we will that's going to be our matrix server configuration. The boot loader information is already good we've got system d boot enabled and we've got the EFI variables touchable if you will by said boot loader for network manager we're going to enable that and for the host name let's just name it nixOS matrix for the time zone I'm going to go ahead and uncomment this and change that to America Los Angeles so for the user account I'll do control V to enter visual block mode 6 jlx to get rid of those comments and what we want to do for this user I'm going to change this user from Alice to Tony that's my name and we can get rid of any Tony specific packages because we're just going to use system packages and we'll set the password manually one time all right so now for the packages same deal here control V 3 jlx of course I want them I want git I think that's all we need for right now all right and for the services we want open SSH and we also want nginx so we'll do services dot nginx dot enable equals true and then to set up a let's encrypt we're going to do security dot acme that's going to equal accept terms equals true defaults dot email this is going to be your email here for me I'm going to do Tony at Tony by the way dot com and that looks pretty good to me so we've devoted the configuration file to about 40 lines and that's going to be good for now so let's go ahead and move on to the next step here all right so let's go ahead and create that matrix dot nix file and instead of a YAML config or what have you this is going to be very clean but it might be a little bit technically dense so I will make this more of an example template file in a public repo and you can simply clone that and a link will be provided for that below the subscribe button all right so let's jump into this matrix file here it's to colon e mnt at cnxos matrix dot nix and in this file let's start the process here so we're going to open this up here with a config packages and lib and the spread operator here it's just clear some variables here we're going to make the domain equal Tony by the way dot com and for you guys your domain is going to be the domain at which you own so you can purchase a domain anywhere somewhere like epic or what have you but once you've gotten that domain you can put your domain here for me mine is Tony by the way dot com so I'm going to do that and my matrix domain is going to be matrix dot domain so we'd matrix dot Tony by the way dot com the client config that's going to be m dot home server dot base URL we're going to make that hgps matrix domain here and then the m dot identity server just going to make that empty here so since the identity server here is empty that will just tell matrix clients to find the home server where it will be served at dot well known slash matrix slash client so moving on to server config here we got server config we're going to make that equal to m dot server and again that's going to be matrix domain on port 443 this is going to tell other matrix servers where to find hours for federation it's also going to be served at slash dot well known matrix server so other matrix servers will know where to find hours for federation through 443 all right so let's add this helper function here for well known so we can avoid code duplication later we'll call it make well known it's going to be data make it a string here to make that default application json for the type we're going to add the header access control allow origin star and then we're going to return 200 converting this data to json so that'll create the engine next configuration snippet to respond with cores headers for the well known endpoints all right so we've got all the variables we need to start creating our configuration here so we'll use this in keyword here and we're ready to start configuring all right so let's start setting up synapse here so we'll do services dot matrix synapse first of all we're going to need to enable it and then the settings are going to be server name the server name is going to be the domain and the public base URL it's going to be HTTP s matrix domain if we look back up here the matrix domain is matrix dot 20 by the way dot com so that's that public facing you base URL so we've got synapse enabled here and we've got the server name set to 20 by the way dot com and the public facing base URL setting set to matrix dot 20 by the way dot com which is good for what we need it's going to close out a couple of these curly braces we've got this last one closed out already so let's add some listeners here we'll do listeners equals so we'll listen on port 8008 we'll do bind addresses to local host here or 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot 1 type is going to be HTTP TLS is false x-forwarded that's going to be true and for the resources we'll do client for the name and federation for the names and we will set the compression to true so this will configure synapse to listen on local host 8008 for the client federation traffic we're not going to need TLS here because engine x handles that and x-forwarded equals true will trust the proxy headers coming from engine x so let's move on to the database configuration so for the database we're going to use a postgres database here it's going to be psy copg2 we need to allow non-celocals so we'll do allow unsafe local equals true and then for your arguments for the arguments we'll do user is going to be matrix synapse the database is also going to be name matrix synapse and the host is going to be slash run postgres SQL so the database is going to be that unix socket connection on postgres SQL so we're working on settings here we've got the listeners we've got the database let's go ahead and add some other settings here we'll do max upload so for the max upload size in megabytes let's set that to 100 so we don't need nitro to upload a two megabyte file we can just set that here the URL preview enabled let's set that the true as discussed previously we're going to set enable registration to false which will disable public registration so you can only manually register on this server via shared secrets and then for enable metrics we have to explicitly set that to false because we don't care about from atheist metrics and then we just have to set this registration shared secret path it's going to be a hard-coded path here var lib matrix synapse registration secret and we're almost done with these synapse settings here we've got one more thing we got to do and that's going to be the trusted key servers we're going to add matrix.org as the server name for the use trusted key servers there and that should be it for the synapse settings so let me just quickly take a look at some of these and make sure we've got everything covered zoom out of it here so we got the domain stuff here to delete that random line here the settings we got the database here it's correct got the miscellaneous settings yeah looks good so let's keep on moving here need to add a block for postgres as a service so we'll do services dot postgres SQL and for this service we're going to enable it and then we're going to ensure creation of the matrix synapse database and for the insured users we're just going to make one user here and that's going to be matrix synapse we're going to grant ownership to matrix synapse as the user and that's good to go for the postgres setup and the last service we need to insure and the last service we need to configure is the actual engine x server so let's go ahead and do so here so we'll do services dot engine x dot virtual hosts that's going to be that 20 by the way dot com and what you're going to do and what I have in my home config is enable acme and force SSL and we need to explicitly set the well known discovery file location for the client and for the server here so for the server we're going to do dot well known slash matrix slash server we're going to use our well known helper function we made and then we're going to pass in the server config for the client same thing here we'll just replace server here with client and that looks good all right and then for the matrix sub domain we're going to create another virtual host but instead of domain here we're going to do matrix domain same thing here with acme and force SSL but the locations are going to be a little bit different here we'll do proxy pass and we're going to set a reverse proxy from matrix dot Tony by the way dot com to the local synapse on port eight thousand and eight so let's set that up here HTTP one two seven dot zero dot zero dot one colon eight zero zero eight and a little bit of extra config here so for these engine x extra config settings we want to preserve the original clients IP address so without setting the x-forwarded for remote adder synapse is only going to see local hosts as a source but the remote address actually contains the real client IP so obviously this is required for red limiting and enforcement banning et cetera and then for forwarded proto we need to tell the back end whether the original connection was HTTP or HTTP s and that's what scheme holds for you what could happen here if you don't set this is that synapse could generate an HTTP link even if somebody's connected via HTTP s so we need to ensure that the scheme matches the original connection and then to preserve the original host name from the clients request we're going to set the header explicitly here in engine x but yeah we can edit some firewall configuration and then we should be done with this file so let's go ahead and do that all right so all that's left to do now is simply open port 8448 for federation here so we'll do networking dot firewall dot allowed TCP ports that's going to be 8448 and that's going to be it here so we're good to save and quit that file so we're going to see what we have here we'll do in LSLA we've got that matrix dot the configuration dot next so all we need now is the flake all right so let's generate the flake template here in order to do that we're actually going to have to run this very verbose command here it's going to be nix and then specify the experimental feature nix command and then also specify the experimental feature nix flakes and there we go we've got that flake dot nix in in this flake we're going to open up with them here change the description to matrix home server by the way keep everything on unstable here and then for the outputs we're going to change this we're going to change all this actually for the outputs we're going to do nixOS configurations dot nixOS matrix it's gonna be our host name we'll do nix packages dot lib dot nixOS system we'll do system equals x86 64 dash Linux the modules are going to be configuration dot nix and that's it it's very super minimal flake here so we are ready to install our system here we're going to go ahead and run nixOS install dash dash flake mnt etsy nixOS and that's going to be nixOS matrix and then just going to let that rip here all right looks like there were no syntax errors and any of those files which is good and again we can ignore that boot warning it's just going to complain that boot is readable by all users it's totally fine for us in our context because we just have the one user here so for the password this is going to be your password for your user to access this machine as root we also want to set a password for the toni user that we created so we'll do nixOS enter dash dash root mnt and then we're going to run this as the shell command and there we go so we are good to reboot here so let's go and do that so at the system d boot i've rebooted and i see the nixOS services so let's log into our user toni perfect to a set font dash d system ttl status matrix synapse and there we go it's running perfect let's take a look at the postgres sequel perfect that's also running and then let's take a look at nix and then we go so it looks like all three services are good to go and we are ready to create admin account and create some public rooms so let's create a new user here we're going to run pseudo matrix synapse register new matrix user so for the local part i'm going to do toni for the password we'll set that up here and then i'm going to make it an admin and there we go so once you've done that you're ready to move on to the next step which is configuring your server in a client so you can just let this server hang and just never touch it again in the access it through other machines so i've logged back into element but this time i've used my toni by the way dot com domain instead of the matrix dot org normi domain and i have the admin account that i just set up so from here you can literally just create a new room here and i can make a public room here and so since i'm converting people over from discord to matrix here let's just use one of my discord rooms and i have a discord room for code review so we'll call it the code review and the top it will be hello world print discussions and implementations it's going to be a public room we'll call it code colontony by the way dot com just create that room so if i want to i can just post this in the general Linux channel here so i've got the general Linux room i've got the rice room here where you can post some of your rice is then i've got a room here for oxwm to kind of discuss some oxwm stuff so so i like i said earlier it looks like discord we've got basically channels here and look we got somebody already joining the room here so we're gonna migrate from discord over to matrix and xmpp i will still keep the discord server up but for the time being i'm going to try to migrate over here to matrix and if you want to find me it's going to be easier to reach me on matrix but yeah all right thank you so much for checking out the video here if you have any questions about matrix or xmpp or anything Linux bst or free and open source software related drop a comment and i will put it in the pipeline so the thing about matrix is it perfect no is it as polished as discord no are there federation issues yes but we'll matrix ask you for your driver's license well no because you will self-host the server will matrix ban you for thinking incorrectly or thinking outside the box no because again you will host your server does matrix scan your messages for advertisements again no because you're gonna host your server does matrix force you to agree to a new terms of service every three months no does matrix have a new update every other day because somebody at the discord company has to validate their job time no okay so as i said thanks for checking out the video come join me over on matrix come join me on xmpp and as always i could not end the video without an obligatory new fetch", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.68, "text": " The year is 2040.
